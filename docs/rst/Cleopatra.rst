About Cleopatra

Systems Automation, Configuration Management and Infrastructure by code implemented in PHP.

My original core programming skills are in PHP - and it's high time that PHP engineers had the same level of agile tools natively availab;e to other languages. The more it becomes a requirement for us to implement these practices, the more pressing the need for tools. We felt it was time for Configuration Management, Infrastructure as Code, and Everything as Code in PHP.

Cleopatra is the result of that work. Dapperstrano was configuring a website automatically to PHP code based settings, so why not the same for the system it was running on?. It would mean that we could configure quite a few important tasks in an Agile team quickly. Cleopatra can configure Desktop, Server or Client machines, and comes with a few templates for each that will work straight out of the box. Cleopatra aims to be able to configure any of the business functions or programs that you need in your stack.

Cleopatra can also install or update any of the other Pharoah Tools applications on your system. It's the recommended way to install them.
